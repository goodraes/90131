33. The people of the world, half ephemerality, and butterfly is ephemerality of shit, but still for its color, dizzy.
Feel most beautiful lives all the magic and has set up a file in the change highlights the mystery.
Wrote so many, is still the eyes can see, the heart want.
One day I saw this article to a friend, he said you haven't walked into him.
I said, a man completely into the possibility of another person's heart is zero, only efforts to close.
He said he was thinking about this problem.
A seemingly simple and not simple question.
